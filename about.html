  	<h3>About Me</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Hi! I'm PK or Lauren - I use both names interchangeably. My pronouns are they/them. I'm a first-year in Matthews and most likely concentrating in Computer Science.</p>
  
  <p>Most of my past work has been with <a href="www.tinkeringschool.com">Tinkering School</a>, where I've taught and supported eight to sixteen year old tinkerers in making enormous structures and moving mechanisms of their own design. One of my favorite projects was this three-story wooden rocket ship:</p>

  <p>I'm also part of the Tinkering School: Mars Missions team. Over the pandemic, we designed a fully virtual collaborative experience for people on Earth to drive rovers "on Mars."</p>

  <p>In my free time, I like to bake sourdough bread and immerse myself in the fantasy worlds of books and games.</p>
