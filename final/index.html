  <p>See my <a href="../01_intro/index.html">final project proposal</a> page.</p>

  <p>Here's an idea for a bracelet version. It's extremely preliminary because the most important thing is fitting all the electronics. The space on top would be for the electronic components. Ideally, it doesn't require the whole entire arduino, just a radio/wifi/we haven't learned about IoT yet but whatever component does that. The bracelet has flexibility in the arms so that you can put it on, although I'm not sure if that'll work well with brittle PLA. If it doesn't, I will look into other filaments or a hinge-based bracelet that doesn't rely on flexibility.</p>
